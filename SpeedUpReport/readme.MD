### System Info
- CPU: Ryzen 5 5600h
- number of Cores: 6
- number of Threads: 12
- RAM: 16gb
- GPU: Integrated 
- OS: Ubuntu VM

### Method
The "Threads" variable was set to a number specified in the project spec, either 1,2,4 or 8. After the number was set, the program was run multiple times, values of the execution speeds achieved were recorded. The "Threads" variable was then changed to a threadno which had not been checked and the process was repeated.

### Visualisations
- Average execution speeds for each Thread Number
